A comprehensive weather forecasting platform that combines the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model initialized with Global Forecast System (GFS) data. The forecasts are visualized using Leaflet maps with KML overlays for Australia, China, India, and West Africa regions, providing high-frequency updates at 15-minute intervals. Rainfall forecasts are overlaid with wind direction, speed, pressure, and pressure centers (High and Low).

## 📱 Quick Start

1. Visit [EastwindConsult Weather](https://nextgenworldweather.github.io)
2. Select your region of interest
3. Choose from available weather parameters:
   - Reflectivity
   - Outgoing Long-wave Radiation
   - Rainfall
   - Temperature
4. View the WRF-generated forecast

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Advanced Forecasting**: Numerical weather predictions using the WRF model
- **Interactive Maps**: Leaflet integration for dynamic forecast displays
- **Comprehensive Overlays**: Rainfall data with wind direction, speed, and pressure information
